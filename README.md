# Broken REST Booleans

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

### What is included

There are two connected rest datasources, `rest1` & `rest2`. They only differ in that `rest1` has operation with `boolean` typed variables in it's template's `body`, while `rest2` has only other variable types.

### What fails

These boolean variables break `strong-swaggger-ui` because they neither get a `type` property attached nor does their schema have a `$ref` property that the `SwaggerUi.Views.ParameterView.render()` is expecting. This causes the Handlebars `isArray` helper attached in `SwaggerUi.Views.ParameterView.initialize()` a to throw an error (line 32765), since `param.type` is undefined.

### How to reproduce

Just clone this project, cd into the directory, and run: 
```sh
slc run
```

Head to your http://localhost:3000/explorer/ and you'll see that the ui fails to finish loading. The dev console will report an error: 
```error
swagger-ui.js:32765 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined
```

If you change the `RestModel`'s `dataSource` property in the `server/model-config.json` to `"rest2"`, and rerun the server, the swagger ui will now finish loading and you'll see the fully populated operation.
